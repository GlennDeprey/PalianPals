# Advanced Breeding

Below you will find all information gathered within the **community and external sources combined**.

Advanced Breeding focuses on techniques to **target specific traits or trait combinations** for your animals.

---

## ü•† Technique 1: Trait Reset & Targeting
This method is used when an animal already has unwanted traits, and you want to force a **specific trait outcome**.  

### Steps:
1. **Reset Traits**  
   - Use an **Oopsie Cookie** on the animal.

   - Use this to remove all traits currently on the animal, leaving it ‚Äúblank.‚Äù  

2. **Apply a Trait Treat**  
   - Feed the animal a **Trait Treat** to assign a new trait.

   - Repeat Step 1 and 2 until the animal belongs to the **correct Trait Group** ur targeting (see **Functional Traits** page for grouping details).  

3. **Refine with Reroll Cookie**  
   - Once the animal is in the correct Trait Group, use a **Reroll Cookie**.

   - This will shuffle traits within that group until the **desired trait** appears.  

---

## üéØ Why Use This Method?
- Guarantees the animal is **locked into the right group** before targeting.  
- Reduces wasted attempts on traits outside of the group you want.  
- Makes breeding for **rare or high-value traits** much more efficient.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips & Notes
- This method can be **resource-intensive** (multiple cookies & treats).  
- Always double-check the **Trait Group** before investing more items.

---

## üß¨ Technique 2: Triple Breeding Method
This method uses **three animals of the same species** to increase your chances of producing an offspring with the **desired trait combination**.  

### Steps:
1. **Prepare Three Animals**  
   - Obtain **3 animals of the same species**.  
   - Ideally, each should already have useful or compatible traits (following **Technique 1: Trait Reset & Targeting**, you could end up with 3 different animals with **1 prefered trait**).  

2. **Breed Strategically**  
   - Breed the 1st and 2nd animals ‚Üí keep the baby if it shows the desired trait(s).  
   - If not, try again with a **Go_Next_Cookie**.

   - Repeat as necessary until the offspring has **2 target trait combination**.

3. **Final Combination**  
   - Ensure that you have the offspring with the **targeted trait combination**.  
   - Breed the **Offspring animal** with 3th animal.  

---

## üéØ Why Use This Method?
- Gives you a **larger trait pool** to work with instead of relying on just 2 parents.  
- Allows you to **cross-check offspring** between different pairs.  
- More efficient for stacking **multiple traits** into a single animal over generations.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips & Notes
- This technique is slower than simple breeding but **far more reliable** for rare traits.  
- Always keep backups of your ‚Äúfounder animals‚Äù so you don‚Äôt lose progress.  
- Works best when you already know which **Trait Group** you‚Äôre targeting.
