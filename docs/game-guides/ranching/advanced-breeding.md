# Advanced Breeding

Below you will find all information gathered within the **community and external sources combined**.
Advanced Breeding focuses on techniques to **target specific traits or trait combinations** for your animals.

## ü•† Technique 1: Trait Reset & Targeting
This method is used when an animal already has unwanted traits, and you want to force a **specific trait outcome**.  

### Steps:
1. **Reset Traits**  
   - Use an **Oopsie Cookie** on the animal.

   - Use this to remove all traits currently on the animal, leaving it ‚Äúblank.‚Äù  

2. **Apply a Trait Treat**  
   - Feed the animal a **Trait Treat** to assign a new trait.

   - Repeat Step 1 and 2 until the animal belongs to the **correct Trait Group** ur targeting (see [Functional Traits](../functional-traits) page for grouping details).  

3. **Refine with Reroll Cookie**  
   - Once the animal is in the correct Trait Group, use a **Reroll Cookie**.

   - This will shuffle traits within that group until the **desired trait** appears.

## üéØ Why Use This Method?
- Guarantees the animal is **locked into the right group** before targeting.  
- Reduces wasted attempts on traits outside of the group you want.  
- Makes breeding for **rare or high-value traits** much more efficient.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips & Notes
- This method can be **resource-intensive** (multiple cookies & treats).  
- Always double-check the **Trait Group** before investing more items.
