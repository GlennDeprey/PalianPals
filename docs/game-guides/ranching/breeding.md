# Breeding

Below you will find all information gathered within the **community and external sources combined**.
Breeding allows you to combine **two of the same animal species** to produce a new offspring. This is a core mechanic for improving your collection and passing on desirable traits.  

---

## 🐾 How Breeding Works
- You need **two animals of the same type** (e.g., two pekis, two ormuu, etc.).  
- When paired, they will produce a **baby of the same species**.  
- Each parent can contribute up to **five traits** with the **Fanciest Breed Biscuit**.  
- The offspring is generated with a **mix of inherited and possible new traits**.  

---

## 🌱 Trait Inheritance
Each animal can have up to **6 traits**. 

| Inheritance Source | Chance (example) | Notes |
|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| Parent A trait     | 40–50%           | May override Parent B’s trait |
| Parent B trait     | 40–50%           | Same chance as Parent A |
| Mutation (new)     | 5–10%            | Rare, introduces new traits |

> ⚠️ Exact percentages are unknown but this is to give a feeling on how it works.  

Traits can include:  
- **Cosmetic traits**
- **Functional traits**

## 🔄 Breeding Limits
- **Cooldown**: Parents will need rest time before breeding again , which could be solved with **Go Next Cookie**.  
- **Ranch Capacity**: Breeding is only possible if you have enough space in your ranch.

# 🆙 Leveling

Your **Ranching skill** increases as you take care of animals in your ranch.  
Leveling up this skill **unlocks new animals, more purchasable guild store items, more ranching animals slots and guild medals**

---

## 📈 How to Gain Ranching XP
- Feeding animals daily. (Expierence is based on how much the **Focus** has been replenished)
- Petting animals daily. (Experience gain will only happen when the pet does not have the **Status Effect** of **Recently Pet**)
- Collecting produce from animals.

## 🍽️ Best Way to Level
The **most effective method** to quickly level up Ranching is by having animals with the trait:  

- **Healthy Eater V (5)** → Grants **the highest XP gains** when feeding animals.  

This drastically speeds up leveling since feeding becomes the most rewarding source of XP.  

---

## 🎯 Leveling Tips
- Focus on breeding animals with **Healthy Eater traits**, aiming for **Healthy Eater 5**.  
- Always keep your ranch full (within ranch capacity) to maximize XP per day.  
- Prioritize feeding over other activities since it gives the **best XP returns**.
